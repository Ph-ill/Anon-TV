## Getting Started

There are two ways to get Anon TV running on your Android TV device: building from source or sideloading the pre-built APK.

### Option 1: Sideloading the APK (Recommended for most users)


#### 1. Download the APK

1. Visit the [Anon TV GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/Ph-ill/Anon-TV/releases).
2. Download the latest `.apk` file under the most recent release (e.g., `AnonTV-vX.X.X.apk`).

#### 2. Prepare Your Google TV for Sideloading

1. On your Google TV:

   * Go to **Settings > System > About**
   * Scroll down to **Android TV OS build** and tap it **7 times** to enable **Developer Options**.
2. Go back to **Settings > Apps > Security & Restrictions**:

   * Enable **Unknown Sources** for the file manager or sideload app youâ€™ll use (e.g., *Send Files to TV*, *Downloader*, or *X-plore File Manager*).

#### 3. Transfer the APK to Your Google TV

Choose one of these methods:

##### Option A: Using "Send Files to TV"

1. Install [Send Files to TV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yablio.sendfilestotv) on both your phone and Google TV.
2. Send the `.apk` file from your phone to your Google TV.
3. Use a file manager on your TV (like **FX File Explorer** or **X-plore**) to locate and open the APK.

##### Option B: Using "Downloader" App

1. Install the **Downloader** app from the Play Store on your Google TV.
2. Open it and enter the direct link to your APK (host it elsewhere or use a GitHub raw link).
3. Download and install the APK directly.

#### 4. Install Anon TV

1. Locate the transferred APK on your TV.
2. Open it and follow the on-screen prompts to install.
3. Launch **Anon TV** from your app drawer.


### Option 2: Building from Source (For Developers)

This approach is for developers who want to modify the code or contribute to the project.

#### Prerequisites

*   Android Studio (recommended for development and emulator setup)
*   Android SDK (API 34 or higher)
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or higher
*   Git

#### Build Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ph-ill/Anon-TV.git
    cd Anon-TV
    ```

2.  **Set up Android SDK (if not already configured):**
    Create a `local.properties` file in the project root and add your SDK path:
    ```properties
    sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk
    ```
    (e.g., `/home/youruser/Android/Sdk`)

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew assembleDebug
    ```
    The debug APK will be located at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

4.  **Install on device/emulator:**
    ```bash
    adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
    ```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

- **"App not installed" error**: Make sure USB debugging is enabled and you've allowed installation from unknown sources
- **ADB not recognized**: Install Android SDK Platform Tools or use Android Studio's built-in ADB
- **Build errors**: Ensure you have the correct JDK version and Android SDK installed
- **Emulator issues**: Use Android Studio's Device Manager to create and manage Android TV emulators

#### Getting ADB

- **Windows**: Download [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
- **macOS**: `brew install android-platform-tools`
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install adb` (Ubuntu/Debian) or equivalent for your distribution

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

*   **Multi-Imageboard Support:** Allow users to configure and browse content from various imageboards beyond the initial implementation.
*   **Search Functionality:** Implement search capabilities for threads and posts.
*   **User Interface Improvements:** Enhance the visual design and add more customization options.
*   **Caching:** Implement local caching for faster loading times and offline browsing.
*   **Settings Screen:** Add a dedicated settings screen for user preferences.
*   **Error Handling & Feedback:** More robust error handling and user-friendly feedback mechanisms.
